              The Cabbage White Butterfly (<em>Pieris rapae</em>) is a charming spectacle with
              closed wings, resembling a smaller version of the Pieris brassicae. Its topside is a
              delightful creamy white adorned with subtle black tips on the forewings. Females
              showcase an extra touch with two black spots at the center of their forewings. Flip to
              the underside, and you'll find a soft yellow canvas sprinkled with dainty black
              speckles. Mistaken for a moth due to its unassuming appearance, this butterfly unveils
              a wingspan ranging from 32–47 mm (1.3–1.9 in). In flight,
              <em>Pieris rapae</em> exhibits a graceful wingbeat, fluttering about 12.8 times per
              second. Explore the simple yet captivating beauty of this butterfly, where elegance
              meets subtlety in every delicate detail.

              <strong>Small Whites</strong>, scientifically known as
              <em><abbr title="Pieris rapae">P. rapae</abbr></em
              >, engage in a fascinating dance of life across
              <strong>Europe, Asia, and North Africa</strong>. Accidentally introduced to Quebec in
              1860, they swiftly conquered North America, spreading from Lower Austral to Canada.
              <br /><br />
              A single female can be the matriarch of millions in just a few generations. In the
              British Isles, they grace the skies twice a year, while in North America, they flutter
              continuously from spring emergence to fall's frosty embrace.
              <br /><br />
              These delicate creatures prefer diverse plant associations and can be spotted in
              towns, natural habitats, and even venturing into forest clearings. Distinct subspecies
              like <em><abbr title="Pieris rapae rapae">P. r. rapae</abbr></em> in Europe and
              <em><abbr title="Pieris rapae crucivora">P. r. crucivora</abbr></em> in Asia showcase
              the evolutionary tapestry of these enchanting butterflies. <br /><br />
              Their life cycle, from egg-laying on cabbage family plants to caterpillar feasts on
              cabbages and pupa transformations, unfolds as a captivating journey in the world of
              Small Whites. As diurnal creatures, Small Whites cover impressive distances, with
              females flying about 0.7 km per day. Males tirelessly patrol host plants, contributing
              to the enchanting spectacle of their mating habits.
              <br /><br />
              Join us in exploring the habits and habitats of these remarkable butterflies as they
              traverse continents, leaving a trail of wonder in their wake.

              The small white readily lays eggs on both cultivated and wild members of the cabbage
              family, such as charlock (Sinapis arvensis) and hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale).
              P. rapae lays eggs singularly on the host plant. The egg is characterized by a
              yellowish color and 12 longitudinal ridges. Egg production peaks about a week after
              adulthood, and the female can live up to 3 weeks. Females tend to lay fewer eggs on
              plants in clumps than on isolated plants. Although there's a suggestion of
              isothiocyanate compounds in the family Brassicaceae evolving to reduce herbivory, this
              is not generally accepted due to the small white's immunity to the isothiocyanate
              forming reaction.

              Traditionally known in the United States as the imported cabbage worm, now more
              commonly the cabbage white, the caterpillars are bluish-green, with tiny black points,
              a black ring around the spiracles, and a lateral row of yellow dashes, and a yellow
              middorsal line. Caterpillars rest on the undersides of the leaves, making them less
              visible to predators. The larval stage of the small white can be a pest on cultivated
              cabbages, kale, radish, broccoli, and horseradish. The larva is considered a serious
              pest for commercial growth of cabbage and other Brassicaceae.

            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6">
              The pupa of P. rapae is very similar to that of P. napi. It is brown to mottled-gray
              or yellowish, matching the background color. It has a large head cone, with a vertical
              abdomen and flared subdorsal ridge. The pupa of P. rapae and P. napi can be easily
              distinguished by comparing the proboscis sheath. In P. rapae, the proboscis sheath
              extends far beyond the antennal sheath, while in P. napi, only a very short distance.

        <p style="flex: 1">
          Adult Pieris rapae use a mix of visual and olfactory cues during their foraging flights.
          They show a preference for vibrant colors like purple, blue, and yellow in flowers. Some
          flowers even have a UV guide, aiding in the butterfly's nectar search—a crucial aspect of
          their foraging strategy.
          <br /><br />
          When feeding, adults actively seek out specific flower colors, extending their proboscis
          before landing. The butterfly identifies flowers through vision and odor, triggered by
          certain chemical compounds that prompt reflex proboscis extension.
          <br /><br />
          Courtship and reproduction in P. rapae involve captivating behaviors. Males engage in
          mesmerizing aerial displays upon spotting a female. After landing, the male flutters and
          spreads his wings, initiating a courtship ritual. Females use mustard oils to locate host
          plants and lay eggs singly on host leaves.
          <br /><br />
          Mating pairs exhibit unique behaviors, with males benefiting from sodium uptake through
          mud-puddling, contributing to increased reproductive success. In the northern hemisphere,
          adults are active from March to October, with variations in wing spots and size between
          spring and summer adults.
